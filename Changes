Revision history for Perl module File::Touch

0.12 2021-03-20 NEILB
    - Fix for RT#128243, where touching a file in close succession wouldn't
      register the second one for make & other purposes, on systems that
      have finer granularity than seconds. Thanks to Slaven Rezic for
      the suggested fix.
    - Improved opening paragraphs of the DESCRIPTION, including a suggestion
      to always require 0.12 or higher.

    - Time::HiRes doesn't provide utime() on Windows, so now we try and
      load Time::HiRes in a BEGIN block, and only enforce the min version
      if it loaded ok.

0.11_02 2021-03-18 NEILB
    - Looks like I should have specified a min version of
      Time::HiRes. Was getting some fails from CPAN Testers,
      about utime() not being available.

    - Don't die if trying to use O_NONBLOCK fails.
    - Set O_NOCTTY if the local OS supports it.
      (If O_NOCTTY is set and path identifies a terminal device,
      open() shall not cause the terminal device to become the controlling
      terminal for the process).
